Some simple statistics over the Minimum Viable Federated Catalogue provided for the [Gaia-X Hackathon #2](https://www.gaia-x.eu/news/events/gaia-x-hackathon-2):

* `Makefile`: running all tasks automatically
* `get-sds-from-catalogue`: runs a query against the catalogue API to retrieve all Self-Descriptions
* `all.json`: output of the former script
* `stats.json`: filtered output (to be enriched with actual statistics)
